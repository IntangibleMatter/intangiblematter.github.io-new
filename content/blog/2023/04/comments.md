Hey! You might notice something new down at the bottom of my blog posts. It's a
comments section! You can leave comments on my ramblings if you have a Github
account and you sign in to it.

I'm using a system called [giscus](https://giscus.app/) for my comments. It means I
don't have to worry about self-hosting anything, and I can just use github!
Specifically, Github discussions, which is a way for people to talk about a
repo on the site, and it means that I don't need to handle anyone's data
myself! If you don't have a Github account, I highly encourage you to make one!
It's a great community of people who make all sorts of cool open-source stuff,
and it's free and secure enough that I use it to run my comments! If nothing
else, the ability to tell me why the comments section is a bad idea is a good
reason to sign up for Github and comment on this blog!

Alright, have a good one!
