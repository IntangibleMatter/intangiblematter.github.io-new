My music taste changes constantly. I had a long time where I mostly listened to
video game music, then a good few months where I mostly listened to electro.
(Thanks, Just Shapes and Beats!) Recently, though, I've been listening to
hyperpop. For those of you who don't know, hyperpop is a musical genre which
can be loosely defined as a type of music that borrows strongly from pop for
its layout, early 2000s internet for its musical aesthetics, and pretty much
whatever the hell the artist feels like for the lyrics.

The genre is largely characterized by the following traits, though they can
all be taken or left as the artist desires.

- Extreme use of autotune
- Bright synths
- Blown out instruments
- Glitchcore inspirations
- Frequent use of samples

The inclusion of any of the components and their use is entirely up to the
artist, and hyperpop music will frequently vary dramatically from artist to
artist.

## underscores

I first discovered hyperpop when I heard of the album
[*fishmonger* by underscores](#underscores) in a
[video by Alpo Media](https://youtu.be/v9JWUUb8sQw?t=433) where he
reviewed his subscriber's favourite albums. I believe he discusses it at about
7:13. I was in need of some new music at the time, and decided to check it out
because... weird is fun! I was *not* disappointed and ended up with one of my
most listened to albums of 2022.

Underscores is a pretty solid all-around artist, and they're a fairly friendly
entry into the genre. If you want a new artist with a pretty chill style and
some unique sonic elements, give them a check out! I won't go into all of
their songs here, but I just have a few I want to talk about.

### 70%

The opening song off their debut album, *fishmonger*, is a wonderfully bombastic
welcome into the world of underscores. The guitar in this song screeches, their
voice near-inaudibly ratches over the driving rock-esque beats, and include a
fun, albeit depressingly current message for anyone who can decipher them.
While definitely not a song for everyone, it's easily one of my favourite songs
by them.

> They're tryna make something of themselves before the world comes to an end,\
> I guess you never see it coming when it's coming out of left field (Woo)\
> Yeah, he's a pretty solid guy but said his humor's kinda dark,\
> well I wish him the best and hope he keeps his beady little eyes peeled (Woo)\
> She had a shitty day and now we've only made it worse for her,\
> the sky is orange and there's fucking ashes on her windshield (Woo)

### Second Hand Embarrassment

This song is a pretty chill intro to the world of Underscores. Catchy loops,
fun vocals, really just a good song to bop your head to. Not much to say, just
one I'd recommend checking out first if you're just starting your journey, as
it's a lot more friendly to standard music tastes.

## 8485

8485 is the second artist of this genre who I got into, and the first one that
caused me to identify "hyperpop" as something that I liked. She has, as of
late, become my favourite musical artist, and I have probably spent more time
listening to *Hangar* than any other song this decase. 

8485 is an artist
who is based somewhere in Ontario. Her music frequently explores themes of
directionlessness, living in the present, and wanting to escape suburbia.

Also, if you want to look into the lore, it's really cool.

### Hangar

{{< youtube 3TsrJ9kPU3Q >}}
{{< songlink "https://music.apple.com/ca/album/hangar/1561457977?i=1561457978" "s" >}}
**Just want to note: This video also covers about the first minute of**
***Purgatory* at the end of it.**

I feel like *Hangar* in particular, at least to me, speaks to many teenager's
feelings of wanting to escape their hometown, especially suburban or rural
areas. Interestingly, the original title of this post was
***8485 and the Idealization of a False Present***, and I was planning to talk
about how her music makes me feel, even if for a moment, like what our societal
idea of a "real teenager" is. I've never been someone who particularly seeks
out social situations or adventure. On the contrary, I rather tend to avoid
them. This song gives me a brief escape from my lonerish tendencies (something
I continue to struggle with) and, for lack of a better term, maladaptive
daydream myself a world where I can let go of my cares for a minute. Where I
can jump into a friend's car and escape it all for a moment. But for the
meantime I continue to imagine a world where these words ring true for me,
and not just for some ideal other self I wish I had.
This is a song that I've loved for a while now, and I've spent many a
day where I will simply have the drawn out, retroesque synths and longing
vocals looping in my head.

I feel that the final bridge sums the song's core up best with its lyrics:

> But I can't bring myself to\
> Hate me for wanting a break\
> I'll still be here in 5 years\
> Where I made every mistake\
> Sixteen trying to disappear\
> For one week and a half\
> You know it's all an act\
> 'Cause there's still a lot I haven't put into words yet

Ultimately, my mental state while just zoning out to this song can be summed up
in the following image:

### 1:15

{{< songlink "https%3A%2F%2Fsong.link%2Fi%2F1524243510" "m" >}}

I have sung along to this song while miming out a little routine to the lyrics
many more times than I care to admit. It's not even that it's a song that I
relate to! It's again similar to *Hangar* in being such a perfect encapsulation
of a feeling I wish I could relate to. Don't we all want to be an anime girl
with a crush sometimes? Right? Not just me?

Well whichever way, this song's wonderful, upbeat feeling, extremely bright
synths, and lyrics which I only know to describe as somewhat tsundere, are a
wonderful little 2 minutes of music which continues on with 8485's incredible
ability to channel feelings into a little piece of music that almost anyone
can relate to, whether or not they've felt those things themselves.

### Scribbles (feat. Drainpuppet)

{{< songlink "https://music.apple.com/ca/album/scribbles-feat-drainpuppet/1677053939?i=1677053940" "m">}}

This song *just* came out while I was working on the post... and oh my god it
has become my current favourite song within *less than twelve hours* since its
release. I'm gonna just hantiplad about this song for a little bit. The synths
that it's made of are somehow ethereal and deeply grounded. The bass synth that
growls sweeping tones across the lower frequencies gives the song a powerful
base that everything else plays across. The pad's constant drive adds to the
forward stasis of the song.

And the lyrics! *oh. my. god.* I don't know if I've ever felt so seen by a
song. Eighty tackles (what I interpret as, at least) feelings of depression,
isolation, and some level of anxiety with such a level of personal accuracy and
honesty that it feels like it shouldn't be real. Just.. give this song a
listen. It's, quite frankly, fucking amazing.

> You said everything would be fine\
> Promised me some peace of mind\
> Find out I don't keep mine\
> Lose it in a week again\
> You said everything would be fine\
> Everything would be fine\
> Everyday my baseline seeps a little deeper down

### More to check out

I honestly haven't heard and 8485 song that I haven't liked. To be fair I also
haven't heard many 8485 songs. Whichever way, here are the ones I'd recommend
giving a listen off the top of my head.

(This is pretty much just a list of all the songs on *Plague Town* excluding
*Hangar* because I gave that one its own section)

{{< songlink "https://music.apple.com/ca/album/plague-town-ep/1561457977" "m" >}}

***Purgatory*** - A great little song to zone out to which seems to me to be
another one of 8485's songs about relationships and/or suburbia.

***Seer*** - A song with extremely high vocals, and some sort of longing for
someone in what I can only assume is a romantic manner.

***Pure*** - Apparently this song is about a desire to be like christ, but as
a lifelong atheist I can't really relate to that, so to me it's just a nice
little synthy song with some sort of longing lyrics.

***Southview*** - God I adore this breakup song. It does such a good job at
capturing that feeling post-breakup when you don't know exactly what's going on
and you're both giving each other space. This was one of my most listened to
songs during my Big High School Breakupâ„¢.

tl;dr: Go listen to *Plague Town* if you like synthwave music and good singing
paired with great lyrics. Even if you don't still give it a listen! It's a 15
minute long EP so you don't really have much to lose.

## 100 gecs

I'm writing this section as I'm riding the ferry home from the 100 gecs concert
in Vancouver! Or at least, I'm writing this sentence and the previous one
while on the way home. I'm eating poutine so I'm not gonna write a whole
section right now.

Alright, I finished my poutine and I've got a bit of time left before the
ferry docks.

100 gecs is probably the most famous artist that is definitively hyperpop in
the world right now. Their first big hit, Money Machine, was a bit of a meme
when it came out, but I didn't get into them until just after they released
their second album, *10000 gecs*, where most of my favourite songs of theirs
are from. Approximately two weeks after hearing it, the opening song on the
album, *Dumbest Girl Alive*, is my 16th most-listened to song so far this year.
I expect it to rise farther, and then probably fall a little when I get
obsessed with another song sometime later this year.

I don't necessarily have as much to say about their individual songs as some of
the other artists in this list, but they still have some great songs which you should check out!

### 10000 gecs

I know what you're thinking. Isn't this the newer album? Why did you put this
one first? Well the answer is that I put it first because I like it better. It
has most of my favourite songs of theirs on it, and it's also just really
consistently *good*. Lemme list a few standout songs from the album.

#### Dumbest Girl Alive

{{< youtube oXrbMDww9ss >}}

God this one is a bop. It's the opening song on the album, and I don't know if
there's a better way to open an album than by playing the **THX** sound effect.
The lyrics are amazing, stupid, and resonant in typical gec fashion, and are
reportedly somewhat about transitioning. (The line "I did science on my face"
reportedly being a reference to Facial Feminization Surgery, as an example.)

> If you think I'm stupid now,\
> You should see me when I'm high\
> And I'm smarter than I look,\
> I'm the dumbest girl alive

Like, *come on!* That's a fun song. Give it a listen. Please.

#### Hollywood Baby

If you like guitar, give this one a check! It's got a strong electric guitar
at the center of it, and the lyrics are a lot of fun. This song is one that
really gets you pumping easily, with the upbeat tempo, distorted synths, heavy
electric guitar and drums, it's one that definitely has a lot of mass appeal.

#### Doritos and Fritos

{{< youtube 2PWMiy4RysI >}}

Oh. Mygod. This song is such a fun, chaotic mess with noisy guitar, an
*extremely* catchy bass riff, and an overall composition that feels like ska
got hammered and ended up having a one night stand with grunge while both were
dressed in candy goth outfits. I know, it's weird and probably doesn't make
sense, but this song is just... hard to describe! It's fun! It's silly! The
lyrics don't really make sense and it feels like they just pulled random words
out of a hat and then used an Ouija board to contact Dr. Seuss for advice on
how to write lyrics. It's fun. It's pure fun and one of my favourite songs at
the time of writing, and one of the first gec songs that I heard! Give it three
listens. Nobody likes it the first time, but it is *such*. *a*. *bop*.

> Okay, I went to France to get some new pants (ooh!)\
> I went to Greece to get something to eat (ooh!)\
> He said "Shit, all we got's Doritos and Fritos"\
> I said "then give me all of those fucking Doritos and Fritos!"

#### Billy Knows Jamie

I gotta say, 2000s nu-metal is not something I was expecting to be brought
back, but it's not an unwelcome return! Especially from the masters of
genremashing. If you want something with that classic intense guitar/bass feel
and the intense style of every angry 16 year old boy in 2002's favourite genre,
give this a listen! Not for everyone, but still good fun.

### 1000 gecs

#### Money Machine

This is the Gec's biggest hit.
 I don't really have much more to say than that.
