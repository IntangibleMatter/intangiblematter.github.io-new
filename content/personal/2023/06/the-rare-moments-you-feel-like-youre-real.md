You know how some people feel like they're the only real person in the world?\
I have the opposite problem.\
To some degree.

Society paints a very strong picture in our minds of what a "teenager" is
*supposed* to do. And I very rarely find myself meeting those expectations.
Whether it's because of my anxiety, depression, or just general tendencies to
isolate myself socially (lockdown was a bit of a dream come true), I tend to
find myself working on my computer, browsing the internet, and just being alone
with my (admittedly distressing) thoughts. Even if this is a perfectly valid
way to exist, it still doesn't quite *feel* as such. It feels like I'm
*supposed* to be out hanging out with friends, discovering myself, and just
taking time to *be a teen*. But I don't. I don't feel like I ever really take
the time to just be a teen, because I'm too busy being *"mature for my age"* or
desperately clinging on to the memories of the times before my mental health
issues were overwhelming.

I almost always feel like I'm an impostor of a teenager, an impostor of a
person. A desperate attempt to seem anything like what "normal" is *"supposed"*
to be. Not even *normal*, just not *totally disconnected* from this reality's
understanding of how things are *supposed* to be.

I have friends. Good ones. The ones I spend the most *(read: any)* time with
are also socially isolated loners like me, so I really only see them at
school for the most part. There's nothing wrong with that, but then social
media comes into play and I see all of the posts of classmates who
[*I don't even really like all that much*]({{< ref "/personal/2023/04/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons.md" >}})
spending time together and smiling and just... *being teens*. Having bonding
moments they'll remember forever with their friends at the beach at sunset,
sharing who they are, or even just messing around in ways that I not only
rarely *(if ever)* experience, but can barely understand.

So the moments where I feel like I actually exist in the role I have are few
and far between, but they mean a lot to me. They're almost always totally
innocuous things that most people wouldn't think about for more than a second,
but for me they remind me that I exist.

The reason I'm thinking of this now (aside from blasting 8485's *Hangar* at one
in the morning) is because yesterday, after the FullIndie event, I was waiting
on the skytrain platform with a friend and two of their friends who I hadn't
met before. While we were waiting for this train, I took a minute to tell one
of the two friends a whole bunch of assumptions I had about them (most of which
turned out to be approximately right, I'm pretty good at reading people), and
observed their reaction to being perceived by another person while my friend
and their other friend commented on what was going on. I don't know why, but
something about that moment just felt like a moment that you're *supposed* to
be having as a teenager, and the kind of moment I so rarely have.

So now I'm sitting here crying over how I felt while sitting in the cold in
Richmond waiting to go home, and how desperately I want to have moments like
that more often, and how I probably won't.

Maybe they aren't really special moments, maybe they're just moments where the
constant vague dissociation that I barely notice anymore has taken a little
step back, and that's how it feels for me. I don't know.

Anyways, yeah. If you feel like this too, you aren't alone.
