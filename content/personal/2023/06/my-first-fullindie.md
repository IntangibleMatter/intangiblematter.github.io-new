So... I'm writing this on the ferry ride home from my very first FullIndie
meetup! I basically got on a bus *right* after school to get down to the ferry,
then I went into Vancouer and... ate food?

Also all of this was with my friend [River](https://visu.do). They're cool.
Check them out. Without whom I probably would've been having an anxiety attack
for the whole trip so... thanks, Riv!

After we ate, we went down to the Skytrain and went down to the place where the
meetup was happening. We arrived half an hour early, and while we were waiting
for the doors to open two things happened:

1. I *finally* fixed a critical bug in my dialogue bubble renderer, so now I
have visible dialogue bubbles!
2. We met the third person to arrive, who was giving a talk. His name was Cole,
and he was working on a pretty cool game called
[Captain Soda](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1862950/Captain_Soda/).
Check it out! Played the demo, it's a lot of fun. 

After we were invited in, we spent a bit of time in the mostly empty room as we
waited for people to arrive. We talked to a sound designer/composer who I
cannot remember the name of, and some more cool people. We talked to someone
who was working on an Advance Wars-inspired game. While River was still focused
on that, I spotted someone who I *knew* I had to talk to, on account of their
*extremely* gay apparel. Their name was Karl, and they were a web dev/indie dev
who has an [extremely cool website](https://ka.rlphili.ps).

We talked for a bit, then I ended up showing them the progress I had made on my
cutscene engine. Someone who *professionally* does games showed up to look at
it, and asked me some questions. I ended up showing him an old game jam game
I made (Raymond Diceworths), and they seemed to like it! Their play session
got interrupted by the talks starting, though. They *almost* finished the game
after, which was very cool to me. 

The talks were good! The first one was by a professional games writer, and he
had some good things to say about how writers work on games. It was a fun talk.
The second talk was by the guy who was working on Captain Soda, and it was
about pitching to publishers so... *very* useful info for me!

I then got to meet two of River's friends who were also there. They were both
*quite* odd and very not typical, so of course I got along with them
*swimmingly*. They were fun. If you're reading this, River, say hi to the
one named after a fire-related crime for me! It'd be chill to have their
Discord lol.

Probably shouldn't put that in but what the fuck why not it's 11:53 pm
on a Tuesday and it's been a long day.

Then we went to the ferry, had some nice conversations on the transit there,
and then waited for the ferry for like an hour. That brings us to now!

So uh yeah

have a nice night :)

10/10 would go again



Oh my god I just realized I forgot to explain FullIndie!


It's an open group for gamedevs, specifically indie game devs, in the Vancouver
area. That's about it. They're chill.


But yeah g'night y'all!
