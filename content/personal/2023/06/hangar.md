If you held me against a wall with a gun to my head asking me what my favourite
song was, I'd probably have a fatal panic attack.

If I somehow managed to respond, however, I would probably say with very little
hesitation that the answer is Hangar by 8485. It's a song that means a lot to
me, and that I've listened to more times than *any other* song in my music
library. It's a song that means a lot to me, and I have spent an unhealthy
number of days and nights listening to it and nothing else on repeat.

I can't remember exactly how I first discovered Hangar. I think I ended up
looking at 8485's music because I was listening to underscores at the time,
and 8485 was featured in one of my favourite songs of theirs (Your Favourite
Sidekick.) I ended up listening to a few of her songs, but none really clicked
with me at the time all that much.

None, except for one. *Hangar*.

Hangar is a special song to me for a variety of reasons. It's partly the
longevity with which it's stayed in my life, it's partly the lyrics, it's
partly just... all of it. Hangar is a song that, in its sound, *perfectly*
captures my mental reality.

> Come pick me up, I'll pay for gas\
> There's nowhere that I want to be\
> And you'll drive fast, and I won't ask\
> To pick the music or the street\
> And we can talk about whatever\
> And pretend that we won't tell\
> Even pretending to ourselves
>
> You think it's easy where it's darker and I like to feel my heart\
> Speed up with my eyes shut and feel we're doing something we should not\
> So for a time I spend my life just trying to find out when to stop\
> Just trying to guess when we'll get caught
>
> This place is suffocating\
> I'll still be here in five years\
> Like I promise I won't\
> Through the wind in your ears\
> But nothing feels as urgent\
> And these nights are still important\
> And there's still a lot I haven't put into words yet
>
> Every time I feel alive it will feel just like this\
> I'll get the things you did\
> Forget the boy I kissed\
> By the hangar and you'll both be strangers to me\
>
> Tonight it matters how I'm not a person who you want to see\
> 'Cause I like to talk about the hospital and go when I don't need it\
> Just to shot the world I feel it\
> I only ever did it once\
> And it was selfish, it was dumb
>
> But I can't bring myself to\
> Hate me for wanting a break\
> I'll still be here in five years\
> Like I promise I won't\
> Through the wind in your ears\
> But nothing feels as urgent\
> And these nights are still important\
> And there's still a lot I haven't put into words yet
>
> This place is suffocating\
> I'll still be here in five years\
> Like I promise I won't\
> Through the wind in your ears\
> But nothing feels as urgent\
> And these nights are still important\
> And there's still a lot I haven't put into words yet
