It is 7:15 am right now. The snow on the road outside my house is currently about 15cm deep at least and shows no signs of slowing down.
I wake up, look out my window and assume they've declared a snow day. Checking my school's app, however, tells me a different story.

> Dear [my school district] Learning Community:  
> All [my school district] schools will have a DELAYED START today, Tuesday, February 28, 2023, due to inclement weather. All school bus routes will NOT be running this morning on this delayed start schedule. The bus routes won’t be serviced this morning due to the unsafe road conditions for large vehicles on side streets.  
> The snow is variable along the [region], but the interconnectivity of communities where staff and students need to travel through is causing unsafe road conditions for our school buses, staff, and family vehicles during the morning commute all along the [region]. We will, therefore, delay the start of school by 2 hours from your school’s typical bell schedule.
> We care about the safety of students, staff, and families and always want to make the best decision given the conditions.  
>
> Travel safely and stay warm,

No, I didn't omit anything. That trailing comma is there in the original.

I think there's this post-covid mentality that we can get our stuff done through *anything*. "We did schooling while we couldn't see each other for months,
why don't you come in right now despite you barely being able to get out of your house?"
It's just another toxic symptom of the """"work ethic"""" of late-stage capitalism. Just let us have a snow day, we can't get to school. This is just making
our attendance look bad.
