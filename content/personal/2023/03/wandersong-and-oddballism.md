Wandersong is a very special game. Ask almost anyone who's played it, and
you'll find them at the very least agreeing enthusiastically, and more than
likely raving about some moment in the game or another. In addition to this,

Which is, to put it lightly, incredible. But I'm not here today to talk about
how beloved this game is. What I'm here to talk about is Wandersong and
delighting in being an oddball.

Wandersong is a game that came into my life at exactly the right time. I first
heard of it while watching a [video essay](https://youtu.be/cYnylXvk65s)
around June of 2020. It being the Steam Summer sale, I bought it, played it,
and almost immediately had a new favourite game. I was in 8th grade when I
started playing Wandersong, and the final third of that grade had been taken
from me by the COVID-19 pandemic.

I live in a small town in Canada, so for me eight grade was my first year of
high school. At the beginning of it, I was a bright-eyed optimist who couldn't
for the life of him read social signals; and by the end of that year I found
out that a lot of people I thought were my friends hated me, and that maybe my
anxiety had a point sometimes. March of 2020 was a turning point for everyone.
It locked everyone into their homes, forced us all to be accountable for how
our actions would affect others, and gave us all a sense of dread about the
world. This is when I really started to do two things:

1. Isolate myself socially.
2. Start making video games.

Wandersong, incredible game that it is, helped me with both.

If you want to know who I was from when I was little, take a look at the bard
and how they interact with the world. That seemingly endless, eternal optimism
is very similar to how I behaved. Hardships still existed, but I didn't really
let things phase me (at least not openly.) Wandersong was the first time I had
gotten to see a realistic reflection of that in anything. A character who was
not only odd, exceptional, and kind, but one who *delighted* in being so. It's
something that almost every piece of media that targets kids encourages, yet it
almost always feels disingenuous. Wandersong sets this example
unapologetically. You can feel the oddballism and all the pride and nervousness
that comes with that oozing through every inch of the game.

I guess I should probably define oddballism if you can't quite pick out the
exact meaning.

Oddballism is a word made by the wonderful properties of english that allow us
to slap suffixes and prefixes onto other words to make new ones. It is the
nature and philosophy of being an oddball. An oddball, if you don't know the
meaning of the word, is quite simply someone who is eccentric.

Now, this is a rather broad definition, but to me what oddballism means with
its connotations is particularly someone who is bright and kind in their
weirdness. The bard is a perfect example of this, someone who in their entire
journey treats everyone they meet (even someone actively opposing their goals
in an aggressive way) with kindness, care, and respect. At the same time, the
bard *never* compromises on who they are and how they interact with the world.

At the bard's lowest point in the story, Act 4: March of the Happy Factory,
everything they thought about their journey and what they were capable of
was ripped out from under them. They feel, quite frankly, like shit. Yet
despite all these hardships, and everything else going on at this time, they
still treat everyone they meet with the utmost care, kindness, and sensitivity.
I find this an utter inspiration
