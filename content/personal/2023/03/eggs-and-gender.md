Gender is weird.

It's such a social construct yet our society has been built on it on such a
fundamental level that to most it's a *huge* deal for most people to even
*consider* changing from the gender they've been assigned. It's an even bigger
deal because of all the genocidal language that's getting thrown around by
neofascists about trans people as of late.

Which, of course, means it's a great time to resume the questioning I've been
doing on and off for the last 5 years! Totally not dangerous at all! (I mean,
it's really not all thar dangerous for me, thankfully. I'm living in a rather
left-leaning community in Canada, which is generally considered one of the best
countries to be queer in. Unfortunately, right next door to the south is one of
the *worst* countries to be trans in in the western world right now.
Republicans are using all sorts of rhetoric to try and villify them. The scary
part is that, for a lot of the conservatives in america, it's *working*. Fear
sells for a lot of people, and it's hard to pull people out of it a lot of the
time.

With all of these things considered, it is, of course, a *great* time for an
eggshell to start cracking. This round of questioning was kicked off when I
watched Everything Everywhere All At Once and got to see the absolute *icon*
known as Jobu Tupaki. A character who I genuinely still can't tell if I find
hot or want to look like. I've spent a lot of time over the past few days
checking out some trans meme subreddits (why do trans people always have the
best memes, anyways? It's unfair,) and consuming content about being
transfemme. And interestingly, my mind isn't really all that adverse to it.

Am I trans?

I don't know yet.

Am I bothered by questioning?

No. It's always a good thing to question.

Do I wish I had a goth pleated skirt?

Yes, don't all cis men wish this?

Anyways, just a quick little ramble. See y'all next time.
