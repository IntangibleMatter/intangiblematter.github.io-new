Katana ZERO, for those of you who don't know, is a 2019 video game created by
Justin Standard (aka Askiisoft) and a few others. It features difficult
side-scrolling action, tight combat, an amazing soundtrack, beautiful pixel
art, and one of my favourite stories of the past decade. While I *could* rave
about it for hours, I'll do my best to keep this article finite.

Also, in case it wasn't obvious, there will be ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** for Katana
ZERO! Please be warned!
