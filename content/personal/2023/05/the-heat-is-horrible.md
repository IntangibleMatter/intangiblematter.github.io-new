So... it's mid May and the temperature has suddenly shot up by about 10 degrees
where I live. If you lived in Ontario or something, this would probably be
normal, but I live in southwest BC. The temperature getting above or below 8-12
degrees is *weird*, especially this suddenly. Or I guess it isn't weird, just
miserable. Another sucky part of it is that my town isn't frequently this hot
so most buildings don't have air conditioning. 

As a sweater, I have to brace myself for everything that I touch and wear to be
sticky for the next five months. It's going to be *miserable*. Climate change
is bad enough on its own, but combined with El Ni√±o I will be lying on the
floor wearing as little as possible whenever I can.  I *hate* the heat. Let me 
move to Iceland, the temperature range there is -2 - 14 degrees. It sounds so
much nicer....

Sweating is, in my opinion, the worst physical feeling that isn't outright
painful that one can have.
