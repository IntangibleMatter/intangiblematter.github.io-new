My dad (or as I and my family called him, Lala,) had a lot of experience with
making mac and cheese from a box. While he had cancer, he ate a lot of mac and
cheese because most foods didn't taste good to him because of all the stuff in
his body to fight the cancer. One day, when he was too tired to make it
himself, he told me how he always makes it. He, quite honestly, made the best
box mac and cheese (and just straight up mac and cheese- I'm *not* a fan of
the homemade stuff 99 times out of 100) I've ever tasted. Nostalgia bias?
Perhaps. But it's still *really* good, as it had about 55 years of perfection
under its belt.

The following is taken directly from the notes of my phone that I wrote that
day because he told me that this is *exactly* how he wanted mac and cheese.
I've made a few edits to make it easier to understand, but it's pretty much
exactly what he told me.

## Recipe

### You will need

- Butter
- Cream, preferably half and half (or milk, if you *must*)
- Box mac and cheese (KD, Annie's, President's Choice, whatever, etc...)

### Directions

1. Boil some water 

2. When the water is fully boiling add the pasta

3. Cook for around nine minutes - do *not* use a timer (i don't remember
   exactly why)

5. Pour the pasta into the strainer

6. Rinse any foam out of the pot

7. Put the pot on low heat

8. Put a large tablespoon of butter in the pot
