So... it's not exactly a secret that I've struggled to make friendships in
life. I've never been good at reading social signals, I'm always direct about
things that most people are at least *somewhat* awkward about, and I've always
had a lot of niche intrests that most people I know knew little to nothing
about. On top of that, I have social anxiety! Which for me means that
*obviously* someone not replying for a while means that I made a social misstep
that I didn't notice and not that they're busy or something.

Combine all of these together and you get a kid who struggles to make
real life connections, but *thrives* on the internet. Unfortunately, I've
never made any internet friends (so far,) so instead I've become someone who
has a lot of the oft-maligned *parasocial relationships*.

A parasocial relationship, for those of you who don't know, is a
one-directional relationship between someone who creates content and someone
who consumes that content. An example of this might be people who trust Tucker
Carlson on everything because he talks in a way that speaks to them and feels
personal, so people begin to trust him, form relationships with him, and value
what he values. All of this is, of course, one-sided. He has no idea anyone in
his audience exists in particular, and he's just there to make some money and
spread some hate.

Parasocial relationships, despite all of their downfalls, have gotten me
through a lot of my adolescent years. Even if I fully *know* that this is just
a person observing a content creator, I still feel more close to some youtubers
who I follow than some of my own peers. I mean, these people make things that I
find very funny, very relatable, and very enjoyable. If I just knew them in
*person* instead of observing them from a distance over the internet, we would
be good friends, right? I'm anxious, they're anxious, I'm into weird indie
games, they're into weird indie games, I'm 17, they're... 26.

I can't be the only person who finds themselves desperately wanting to be
famous on the internet just to join those social circles that look so *fun*,
can I? The chaos of Alpharad, the nerdy theatrics of Brian David Gilbert, the
unbridled honesty of Jaiden, Illymations, and Let Me Explain Studios...

I know I'll never meet these people, and I know it's stupid and probably
creepy, but I don't know if I'd be here today if I didn't have these pieces of
content to bond to. People are hard and misunderstand you. A youtube video
won't describe your weekend plans and then call you a loser for not going out
to the beach with friends without even knowing that what they just described
as pathetic is the only thing you can do without having a panic attack over
potentially inconveniencing someone.

I have real life friends. I wrote most of this post while a friend was hanging
out at my house. But I've never had many, and there's always some distance. I
will always, to some degree, crave the anonymity, chaos, and joy of having
a cool group of people on the internet to spend time with. It may fade away
someday, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.

Anyways yeah if you're an awkward "loser" who feels like the internet makes
more sense than people do and you would be doing *so* well if you could just
get into those circles, then know you aren't alone. No matter how much it feels
like it.
