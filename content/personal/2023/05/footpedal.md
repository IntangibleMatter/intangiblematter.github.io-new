I *love* dynamic audio in games. Being a game developer, I want to add it to my
own projects. Unfortunately, I'm broke and all existing solutions are expensive
to use (at least without a giant splash screen when you boot up the game.)
Obviously, being a programmer myself, I decided I'd try to write an audio
engine on my own. This is, of course, a completely giant task, and I am not
amazing at programming complex systems, especially at lower levels, so I
pretty much gave up. Before I gave up, though, I mentioned this project to a
friend of mine, [River](https://visu.do), who promptly didn't quite get it
and continued *rewriting the JVM*. A few weeks back, though, they ended up
taking another look at the project, and we started working on it together.

So... Get ready for [Footpedal](https://github.com/skrekhere/footpedal-meta)!
A Free, Open Source piece of audio middleware being written in Rust with a 
frontend written in Godot! We are *super* early on in the process, but stay
tuned here and check out
[River's blog post](http://visu.do/2023/05/08/FootPedal-A-new-beginning/) for
updates!
