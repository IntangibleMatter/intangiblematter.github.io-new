A while back I [made a post]({{< ref "/personal/2023/03/eggs-and-gender.md" >}}) about
my gender and my experience in questioning. I'm happy to announce that my egg
has recently cracked! And... I'm not trans.

Disappointing, right? I know, I was disappointed too. But it's fine to not be
a member of a group with *so many cool members oh my god it's statistically*
*anomalous how many cool trans people there are.* What I am, however, is
someone who doesn't strongly identify with the societal construct of
masculinity. My dad didn't either. ( Oh yeah, if you didn't know, my dad, or as
I called him, Lala, died when I was 15 :/ ) He wore skirts a lot when I was
little and before I was born, he spent a lot of time wearing cool earings, and
he was a twice honorary lesbian, but that's a story for another time. A lot of
his friends were women, and if societal gender was strictly determined by the
way you emotionally interact with the world, he would probably have been deemed
a woman. I feel like that's where I sit. I myself am male, and I'm perfectly
comfortable with that. I just feel a lot more comfortable socially, and a lot
more comradery with afab people than I do with guys most of the time.

So yeah, that's where I'm at. I like being friends with girls and hanging out
with them more than I do guys. Not to say I dislike guys, just that I usually
don't find as much in common with them or get along with them as well.

Also for the one person who stumbles across this blog and is like "oh no!
guys and gals being friends? There's obviously going to be dating!"
First of all, I'm the only (cis) guy in my friend group at present, and I'm
also the only person who isn't aroace. Guys can still think
[girls are all really cute and great](https://youtu.be/Y2Y5KVtU810) without
wanting to be sexual with all of them.
