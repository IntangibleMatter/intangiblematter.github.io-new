So I finally got to watch that movie everyone was talking about last year. It's
honestly *even better* than everyone says. The effects were *amazing*, the
writing was *fantastic*, and the actors were all... \**chef's kiss*\*.

My favourite character was *easily* Jobu Tupekai. She's honestly everything I
aspire to be. A cool, nihilistic, reality warping, amazing looking young adult
who created an object that can destroy the most powerful people somewhat out
of *boredom*. She even *moves* how I want to. Just a little bit crazy, and like
a cutesy cartoon character was given a few doses of evil maniac. People who 
move in an animated way are the *best*. And the head ticking to swap between
dimensions... UGH! It's a brilliant film, and I loved all the characters. 
Waymond was adorable and we all need someone like him in our lives, Evelyn was
*such* a compelling character, and it was all.. ugh. *so amazing*!!!1!1

I love the movie's central concept, too. It's a creative, brilliant way of
multiverse travel that allows for some amazingly hilarious scenarios to take
place. The butt plug scene was definitely a standout in my opinion.

Easily one of my new favourite movies. 11/10. Will probably watch so many
times that it loses some of its meaning to me because when so few things
make you feel like that anymore you've gotta squeeze *every **DROP*** of
dopamine you can.

If you haven't seen it yet. Watch it. It's on Prime. Or buy the blu-ray. It's
*SO* worth it.

__note:__ *hantiplad* is a word a friend and I came up with when we realized
that there wasn't a term for a positive rant
