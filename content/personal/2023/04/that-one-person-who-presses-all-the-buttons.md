Do you have that one person who just somehow perfectly presses the buttons on 
all of your insecurities without even knowing it? That person who just seems 
so untouchable and perfect that their mere existence seems like some cosmic 
joke at your expense? Even if you know they're still human, and that they also
deal with issues like humans do, it just feels like they've figured out a 
method for hiding all of their struggles perfectly?

I've got one of those people in my life right now, and it's even worse because
they're such a genuine and nice person that I can't even contrive a reason to 
justly hate them. The chance they're reading this is next to nothing, but even 
if they are I doubt they know that I'm talking about them.

I wish you the worst and the best. You somehow deserve both.
